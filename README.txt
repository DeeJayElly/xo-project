Project Assessment:
YouTube Trends is a front-end application that was developed in a hurry to show the latest video trends from YouTube.

New features:
Right now it's showing the latest trends only for the United States, but we would like to have a possibility of selecting a specific country to see the latest trends there. Also, we want to specify a category of trending videos, selector is already added in filters, but categories are hardcoded, we want to fetch it from Youtube API, see (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videoCategories/list). The last thing is that we want to implement "infinite scroll", so more videos should be loaded when we scroll to the bottom of the page.

Bug fix:
DONE - When you mouse over the video, you can see on every element of the page "Likes", but it shows always 0, please fix it.
DONE - When we're trying to open some video to play it doesn't work and shows some errors in console, please fix these bugs.
DONE - Slide-nav button (gear) is broken, when you click on it, nothing happens, but it should open filters, please fix it.
DONE - When slide-nav is opened, the close button is also didn't work, fix it also.
On filters slide-nav, we have "Count of videos on the page" slider and when we trying to select more than 50 videos it shows error, please fix it.
DONE - When we open the video on a separate page, filters button should be hidden.
In case if passed wrong video id, the user should be redirected on a page with youtube videos list.
DONE - Selected filters should be saved, so after we will refresh the page, filters should be the same as we chose before.

Notes:
* List of countries can be found in the app.config file
* List of categories should be loaded from Youtube API
* You may add new dependencies in package.json (if needed)
